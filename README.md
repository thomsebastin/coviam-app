# coviam-app
A simple e-commerce page just for practicing Angular.js (_Alpha_) 

# Installation:
Run:
    
    npm install
Then run:
    
    bower install
    
> PS: The project should be cloned to your localhost, as there is an ajax call.
    

# Features:

1. The cart panel should always be visible on the page if there is any item
already added in the cart. **Done**

2. All the required data should be rendered via external JSON file. Item
should be unique. **Done**

 __Data properties are:__
 - Product image
 - Brand name
 - Product name
 - Packing detail
 - Price

3. On clicking on the “add” button item should be added to the cart and cart
summary should be updated. **Done**

4. The ‘-’ and ‘+’ buttons should be visible with the detail shown in wireframe,
if the particular item is already added to the cart. **Done**

5. If an Item is added to the cart and item added quantity is ‘1’ and user click

an item in the cart and user refreshes the page, Item should remain in the

8. You are free to use any color, fonts, layout measurements, product images,
product details etc. . You can develop all other required functionality by
understanding the wireframe properly. **Partially Done**

\* The Remove button and cart button are not in sync.

\# Some of the states are preserved, availing everything doesn't sync well with other sections in the page. 

> Couldn't do the styling and other minor things like syncing remove button with cart button, preserving the state of cart button, due to lack of time. Will be added soon, if given time.
